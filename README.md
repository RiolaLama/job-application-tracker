# JOBSTER 💼

Searching for a job is stressful and messy. It’s hard to remember which company called you back and which one never replied. I built **Jobster** to make that whole process a lot easier to look at.

It’s a simple dashboard where you can track your job applications, see your progress in a chart, and stay organized while you look for your next big role.

### ✨ What’s inside?

* **A Simple Dashboard:** See your total applications and interviews in one view.
* **Progress Charts:** A bar chart that shows you how many jobs you applied for each month.
* **Search & Filter:** Quickly find a specific job by name, status, or type (like "Full-time" or "Remote").
* **Easy Management:** Adding, editing, or deleting a job takes just a couple of clicks.

### 🛠️ Built with

I used the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) to build this project.

### 🚶‍♂️ Give it a spin (Test Account)

You don't even have to sign up to see how it works. You can log in with the **test user** to click around and see some sample data:

* **Email:** `test@mail.com`
* **Pass:** `123123`
